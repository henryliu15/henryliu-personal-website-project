        <p>
          Originally born in Manhattan, New York - raised in Flushing, New York and the Villages, Florida. I currently live in Tampa, Florida with my wife and puppy. In May 2018, I graduated from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing and minor in Information Technology. Since then, I have been working with Ford Credit.

          I aspire to be a software engineer because it is something that I've always wanted to pursue. Ever since I was in middle school, I've always felt curiosity to explore computers and how their respective software/operating systems functioned. I also believe that technology is constantly evolving and continues to be an important factor in building our future. With technology being as important as ever, I want to be able to play my part by learning and exceling as a software engineer.
